## Application Description: 

Welcome to the MySwoleMate application (not my choice of name!) - a .NET application designed to help personal trainers manage trainees and appointments

Revature, a company committed to training entry-level software developers, provided the original template for this project (now making up around 15% of the overall application).  That template included some basic namespace structure, along with the heavy lifting for the front-end graphics. My task has been to create database tables, relate them together, access them from Visual Studio, and add layers through witch to display and modify that data finally on ASP.NET pages that I would design.  A few instructional videos and several hundred Google searches later, the first version of this application was birthed.  From there the application has been, and is still in the process of being, upgraded to utilize the tools and frameworks listed below.

Though unlikely to ever benefit a real personal trainer, this project has served me well as a thorough introduction to .NET development.


## Tools and Frameworks Used

Developed using Virtual Studio, MS SQL Server, ADO.NET, ASP.NET Web Forms and Server Controls, and IIS Deployment

Currently implementing Entity Framework for simpler data access, along with jQuery for a more robust front end

## Deployment Instructions
