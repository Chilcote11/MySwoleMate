## Application Description: 

Welcome to the MySwoleMate application!  A .NET application designed to help personal trainers manage trainees and appointments

Revature, a company committed to training entry-level software developers, provided the original template for this project (now making up around 15% of the overall application).  A few instructional videos and several hundred Google searches later, the first version of this application was birthed (see `branch: master`).  From there the application has been, and is still in the process of being upgraded to utilize the tools and frameworks listed below.

Though unlikely to ever benefit a real personal trainer, this project has served me well as a thorough introduction to .NET development.


## Tools and Frameworks Used

Developed using Virtual Studio, MS SQL Server, ADO.NET, ASP.NET Web Forms and Server Controls, and IIS Deployment

Currently implementing ADO.NETâ€™s Entity Framework, along with JavaScript's jQuery for a simpler and more robust application

## Deployment Instructions

To run this application, you'll need Visual Studio Community Edition and SQL Server Express
- Installation instructions can be found above in SETUP.docx
- Note: Because Entity Framework is not yet fully implemented, you'll want to checkout the master branch to use version 1 of the application
